Answers to the questions:
1. The most challenging part of the exercise was figuring out which packages
to use. I first used ggmaps, spent a while trying to get it to work, failed, 
then used Andrew's suggestion of osrm.

2. Finding the correct package to use. I also spent an annoying amount of time
trying to get label the map with the place names.

3. I really enjoyed the opportunity to work on a bit of code that produced 
something I haven't done before. Up until now, all my 'coding' experience
 has been with econometrics. 

4. I did not enjoy the amount of time spent trying to get the google API 
to work. That was frustrating. Also, I wish I could have labelled the map.
However once Andrew had given me his code for the nominatim_osm function
and suggested osrm, it was fairly straightforward.
